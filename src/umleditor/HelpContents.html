<h2>Help Contents</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The UML Editor is designed to create, edit, open, and save UML class diagrams. The program
is optimized for Windows 7 and assumes that you have Java 6 (update 20 or higher) installed.
In these help contents, all "click" instructions refer to a left click. Any right clicks 
will be specifically mentioned. Instructions such as File>Save indicate that 
you should select "File" from the menu bar and the "Save" option will be an item in the 
File menu. Commands such as Ctrl+C indicate that you should press the indciated keyboard
buttons (Ctrl and C in this case) at the same time. <br />

<h3><a name="Limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
<p>UML Editor has the following limitations. First, only class diagrams may be added. Other types
of UML diagrams are not supported. In addition, each diagram can only hold a maximum of
500 classes. Another limtation is that labels and cardinality information for relationships
is not included.<br />

<h3><a name="Classes">Classes</a></h3>
<p>To add a class, click on the Add Class button (or press N on your keyboard). Then click
inside the UML Editor window to create the class. To create multiple classes, hold down Shift
on your keyboard while clicking inside the UML Editor window. New classes may also be added
by right clicking in any open area inside the Editor window. In the context menu that appears,
you may choose "Add Class" to add a class where the right click occured. <br />
<br />
To select a single class, simply click on it. The class will be highlighted to indicate that
it was selected. To select multiple classes, hold down the Ctrl button on your keyboard while
clicking on classes. As you select multiple classes each one will be highlighted to indicate
that it was selected.<br />
<br />
To edit a class, double click on the class to launch the Edit Class window. You can modify
the class name, attributes or methods. To add attributes or methods, fill out the blank
field in each section and then press the New button. All fields will be updated in real time.
To remove any changes made, press the Discard Changes. To confirm changes and close the 
window, press the Close button. You may also access the Edit Class window by right clicking
on any class and choosing "Edit." <br />
<br />
To move a class, hover your cursor over a class's name field. The cursor will change to
the move symbol. Click down and drag the class to a new location and then release your
click. Any relationships associated with the class will also be moved with the class.
Multiple classes may be moved by using the same method. Simply select more than one
class and then move your cursor over one of the selected classes. When you click and
drag to move the class, all highlighted classes and any associated relationships are 
moved as well.<br />
<br />
To delete a class, click on a class to select it. The Delete Button in the toolbar will 
become active. Click on the Delete button (or press the Del key on your keyboard) and the
class will be deleted along with any relationships to/from the class. You may also
delete a class by right clicking on the class and choosing "Delete." To delete multiple
classes, simply select any classes you wish to delete and then either press the Delete
button on the toolbar or press the Del key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
To cut, copy, and paste classes, first select a class. To cut, press Ctrl+X or choose
Edit>Cut from the menu bar. To copy, press Ctrl+C or choose Edit>Copy from the menu bar.
You may also Cut and Copy by right clicking on a class and choosing "Cut" or "Copy" 
from the context menu. To paste, press Ctrl+V, right click on an open area and choose "Paste,"
or choose Edit>Paste from the menu bar. When using the keyboard shortcuts and right click
menu, the pasted classes will appear next to your mouse cursor. When pasting from
the menu bar, pasted classes will appear in the center of the screen. <br />

<h3><a name="Relationships">Relationships</a></h3>
<p>To create a relationship, first ensure that two classes have been created. Then,
using your mouse, click inside your first class (without the move symbol activated).
Drag your mouse and release your click when your cursor is on the second class. You will
see a line while you drag your mouse. After releasing your click on the second class, the 
Relationship Chooser window will appear. Choose which type of relationship you want 
(composition, aggregation, dependency, association, and generalization). The selected 
relationship will be drawn between the two classes.<br />
<br />
To shape a relationship, click on a relationship to select it. Two endpoint, blue nodes 
will appear. Click and drag on an endpoint to move it around the class. To create a new node
along the relationship's path, Ctrl+click anywhere on the relationship (or right click on
the relationship and choose "Create Node"). Then click and drag this node to change the shape
 of the relationship. <br />
<br />
To edit a relationship, double click on the relationship or right click on the relationship
and choose "Edit." The Edit Relationship window will appear. You may choose which new type 
of relationship you would like drawn or change the direction of the relationship. <br />
<br />
To delete a relationship node, click on the node to select it (the node will turn red), 
then press the Delete button on the toolbar (or the Del key on your keyboard) to delete the 
node. The relationship will then redraw itself. Endpoint nodes may not be deleted.  <br />
<br />
To delete a relationship, click on a relationship to select it. Then press the Delete
button on the toolbar (or the Delete key on your keyboard) to delete the relationship. A
relationship may also be deleted by right clicking on the relationship and choosing 
"Delete."<br />

CTRL+S on your keyboard). A Save window will appear, allowing you to choose the
name and location of your UML diagram. Choosing File>Save (or pressing Ctrl+S)
will update the saved file. To explicitly save to a different location, choose
File>Save As from the file menu. After saving a diagram, the diagram's name will serve
as a title for the diagram in the tab bar. In addition, any changes to a saved diagram
will result in an asterisk (*) next to the tab's title to indicate that there are 
changes that need to be saved.<br />
<br />
