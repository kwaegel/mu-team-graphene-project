<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This program is designed to create, edit, open, and save UML class diagrams. The program
is optimized for Windows 7.</p>
<br />
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>To add a class, click on the Add Class button (or press N on your keyboard). Then click
inside the UML Editor window to create the class. To create multiple classes, hold down Shift
on your keyboard while clicking inside the UML Editor window. <br />
<br />
To edit a class, double click on the class to launch the Edit Class popup. You can modify
the class name, attributes or methods. To add attributes or methods, fill out the bottom
field and then press the New button. All fields will be updated in real time. To remove
changes made, press the Discard Changes. To confirm changes and close the popup, press the
Close button. <br />
<br />
To move a class, hover your cursor over a class's name field. The cursor will change to
the move symbol. Click down and drag the class to a new location and then release your
click.<br />
<br />
To delete a class, click on a class to select it. The Delete Button in the toolbar will 
become active. Click on the Delete Button (or press the Del key on your keyboard) and the
class will be deleted along with any relationships to/from the class. <br />
<br />
To cut, copy, and paste classes, first select a class. To cut, press Ctrl+X or choose
Edit>Cut from the menu bar. To copy, press Ctrl+C or choose Edit>Copy from the menu bar.
To paste, press Ctrl+V or choose Edit>Paste from the menu bar. When using the keyboard
shortcuts, the pasted classes will appear next to your mouse cursor. When pasting from
the menu bar, pasted classes will appear in the center of the screen. <br />

<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>To create a relationship, first ensure that two classes have been created. Then,
using your mouse, click inside your first class (without the move symbol activated).
Drag your mouse and release when your cursor is on the second class. A relationship
chooser window will appear. Choose which type of relationship you want (composition,
aggregation, dependency, association, and generalization). The selected relationship
will be drawn between the two classes. <br />
<br />
To shape a relationship, click on a relationship to select it. Two blue nodes will 
appear (one at each end). Click and drag on a node to move it. To create a new node
double click anywhere on the relationship. Then click and drag this node to change
the shape of the relationship. <br />
<br />
To delete a relationship node, click on the node 
to select it (the node will turn red), then press the Delete button (or the Del key)
to delete the node. The relationship will then redraw itself.
